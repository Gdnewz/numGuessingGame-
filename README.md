In the number guessing game, the user selects a number within a defined range and then the program guesses the number. If the number guessed is wrong then the user tells the program that is the actual number is greater than the guessed number or not. Similarly, the program again guesses the number until the actual number is not guessed.There two levels, hard and easy levels. Each level has a specific amount of times the user can take a guess, and when the number runs out, the game stops.
